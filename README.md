# reaktor-assignment
This is my solution to the Reaktor assignment about the warehouse application.

I tried to keep it as minimal as possible. The only required dependency are node and express.js.

On the client there are no framework and no tests. Only pure javascript.

The application should work with any modern browser. It can be accessed [here](https://reaktor-assignment-warehouse.herokuapp.com/).
